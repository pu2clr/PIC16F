# Termometer with LM35 or TMP36 sensor and PIC12F and PIC16F with ADC support

In this folder, you will find some projects with the PIC12F and PIC16F series for processing analog signals, particularly for reading voltage outputs produced by temperature sensors like the LM35 or TMP36

## Fever indicator with the small PIC12F675

The PIC12F675 is a compact and versatile 8-bit microcontroller from Microchip Technology, belonging to the popular PIC12F series. It's known for its small size and low power consumption, making it ideal for space-constrained and power-sensitive applications. The PIC12F675 features 1 KB of flash memory, 64 bytes of EEPROM, and 128 bytes of RAM, along with an onboard 10-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), which is quite impressive for its size.
