## Overview

When exploring applications that necessitate analog input, the PIC10F220 stands out as a preferable choice over the PIC10F200. Retaining the foundational attributes of the PIC10F200, the PIC10F220 sets itself apart with the integration of an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) interface. This feature substantially elevates the functionality of the PIC10F220, granting it the ability to directly process analog signals. This functionality is pivotal for projects that demand the monitoring or measuring of analog values. Adding to this, when combined with the 74HC151 multiplexer, the PIC10F220's analog input capabilities can be expanded even further. This synergy allows for the efficient management of multiple analog signals, enhancing the microcontroller's utility in complex environments where space and pin limitations are a concern, yet precise analog data acquisition is required.
