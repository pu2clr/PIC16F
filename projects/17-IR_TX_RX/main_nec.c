/*
Implementing the NEC infrared communication protocol on a PIC16F628A microcontroller requires understanding the NEC protocol's timing and data format. The NEC protocol uses pulse distance encoding of the bits. Each pulse burst (mark – logic high) is of a fixed duration (560 µs), followed by a space (logic low) of variable length to denote a logical "1" or "0".

Logical '0' is represented by a 560 µs pulse burst followed by a 560 µs space.
Logical '1' is represented by a 560 µs pulse burst followed by a 1,690 µs space.
A leading pulse burst (9 ms) and a space (4.5 ms) denote the start of a transmission.
A command is followed by its inverse as error detection.

Sending an NEC Code

To send a command using the NEC protocol, you will first send the leading pulse, then the data byte, its inverse, the address byte, and its inverse, followed by a final pulse to denote the end of transmission.

Implementation Details

Timing Accuracy: The timing of the pulses and spaces is crucial. You need to be as accurate as possible, which might require calibrating your delay functions (delay_us and IR_delay) based on the actual clock speed of your PIC16F628A.
Carrier Frequency: The IR LED should be modulated at a 38 kHz carrier frequency. This is not explicitly shown in the snippets above, but in practice, you turn the IR LED on and off at 38 kHz during the "on" periods of the pulses. This requires setting up a timer or employing precise delays.
The code snippets provided offer a simplified view of the process. They need to be adjusted and expanded based on your specific hardware setup
