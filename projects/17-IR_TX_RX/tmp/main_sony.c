Implementing the Sony SIRC protocol with a PIC16F628A microcontroller in C involves sending and receiving infrared signals with a specific modulation and format. Sony's protocol typically uses a 12-bit, 15-bit, or 20-bit data format consisting of a 7-bit command and a 5-bit device address (for the 12-bit version) and may include extended versions for more devices or commands.
Sony Protocol Basics
Carrier Frequency: 40 kHz
Bit Encoding:

'0' bit: ~600μs pulse followed by ~600μs space
'1' bit: ~1200μs pulse followed by ~600μs space

Start Bit: There is no explicit start bit in the Sony protocol; the transmission starts with the first bit of the message.
Message Frame: Consists of a 7-bit command followed by a 5-bit device address for the 12-bit version, with longer versions adding additional command or address bits.

*** Implementing Sony Protocol Transmission

To transmit a Sony protocol signal, you need to modulate the IR LED at a 40 kHz carrier frequency and follow the timing for '0' and '1' bits as specified.

Function to Send a Sony IR Command

Here is a simplified example function for sending a 12-bit Sony command. This example assumes you're familiar with setting up your microcontroller and configuring the necessary pins for output.

*** Implementing Sony Protocol Reception

Receiving and decoding the Sony IR protocol involves measuring the duration of incoming pulses and spaces to determine whether each bit is '0' or '1'. This can be more complex due to the need for precise timing and the handling of interrupts or polling to detect IR signal changes.

Steps for Receiving
Set Up an Interrupt: Configure an interrupt on the pin connected to the IR receiver that triggers on both rising and falling edges.
Measure Pulse and Space Durations: In the interrupt service routine, measure the time between edges to determine if the pulse or space corresponds to a '0' or '1' bit.
Decode the Message: Once you have captured the entire message, decode it into command and device parts based on the Sony protocol specifications.
Implementing the reception and decoding part requires careful timing and might involve more advanced programming concepts like interrupts and timers, which are specific to the PIC16F628A and your development environment.

This example provides a starting point for transmitting Sony protocol IR commands. Implementing a complete solution, especially for receiving, will require a deeper dive into microcontroller-specific features like interrupts, timers, and precise timing functions.

        IR_LED = 1; // Turn on the IR LED
        delay_us(600);  // Basic pulse duration for both '1' and '0'

        if(data & (1 << (11 - bit))) {  // Check if the current bit is 1
            delay_us(600);  // Extend the pulse for a '1' bit
        }

        IR_LED = 0; // Turn off the IR LED
        delay_us(600);  // Inter-bit space
    }
}
