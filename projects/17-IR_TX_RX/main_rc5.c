Implementing the RC5 IR protocol on a PIC16F628A microcontroller in C involves understanding the RC5 protocol's unique features, such as its Manchester encoding, bi-phase modulation, and the fixed bit length of the messages.

### Understanding RC5 Protocol
- **Bit Format**: RC5 transmits data bits using Manchester encoding, where each logical "1" is represented by a transition from low to high in the middle of the bit period, and a logical "0" is represented by a transition from high to low.
- **Frame Format**: Each RC5 code is 14 bits long, consisting of two start bits (both logical "1"), one toggle bit (changes state with each button press to indicate a new command), 5 address bits (to identify the device), and 6 command bits.
- **Carrier Frequency**: 36 kHz.

### Hardware Setup
The hardware setup remains similar to the basic IR setup described previously, with an IR LED connected to a PIC16F628A output pin for transmission and an IR receiver module connected to an input pin for reception.

### Software Implementation

#### 1. Initialize the System
Initialize the system clock, configure I/O pins, and set up any necessary peripherals. Ensure your IR LED output pin is set for digital output and your IR receiver input pin is set for digital input.

#### 2. Transmitting RC5 Signals
To transmit RC5 signals, you need to generate Manchester encoded signals at the correct frequency. A simple way to do this is by using a timer to toggle the output pin at the correct intervals.

```c
// Define the carrier and half-bit durations
#define CARRIER_FREQ 36e3
#define HALF_BIT_DURATION 889 // microseconds (1/36kHz * 32 cycles for RC5)

// Toggle the IR LED to generate the carrier frequency
void toggleIRCarrier(uint16_t duration) {
    while (duration > 0) {
        // Toggle IR LED on
        IR_LED_PIN = 1;
        __delay_us(13); // Duration for a 36kHz carrier
        
        // Toggle IR LED off
        IR_LED_PIN = 0;
        __delay_us(13); // Complete the cycle
        
        duration -= 26; // Adjust based on delay accuracy
    }
}

// Send a single bit using Manchester encoding
void sendRC5Bit(bool bit) {
    if (bit) {
        // Logical "1": Low to High transition
        toggleIRCarrier(HALF_BIT_DURATION);
        __delay_us(HALF_BIT_DURATION); // Delay without carrier for the second half
    } else {
        // Logical "0": High to Low transition
        __delay_us(HALF_BIT_DURATION); // Delay without carrier for the first half
        toggleIRCarrier(HALF_BIT_DURATION);
    }
}

// Send an RC5 command
void sendRC5Command(uint8_t address, uint8_t command, bool toggle) {
    uint16_t rc5Code = 0x3000 | (toggle << 11) | (address << 6) | command; // Start bits: "11", toggle bit, address, and command

    for (int i = 13; i >= 0; i--) {
        sendRC5Bit((rc5Code >> i) & 0x01); // Send each bit, starting from the MSB
    }
}
```

#### 3. Receiving RC5 Signals
Receiving and decoding RC5 signals involves measuring the time between transitions to decode the Manchester encoded bits. This can be more complex due to the need for precise timing and the handling of Manchester encoding.

You would typically use an interrupt to detect changes on the IR receiver input pin, measure the time between transitions, and then decode this into logical "0"s and "1"s according to the RC5 protocol's Manchester encoding rules.

#### Key Points
- **Timing is crucial**: Ensure your timing for the carrier frequency and bit durations are accurate.
- **Manchester decoding**: Implementing a state machine can be helpful for decoding Manchester encoded signals, especially for detecting the transitions that represent "0"s and "1"s.
- **Practice and Patience**: Debugging IR communication can be challenging. Start with simple commands and use tools like an oscilloscope or logic analyzer to help debug issues.

This overview provides a foundation for implementing RC5 on a PIC16F628A. Adaptations and optimizations may be required based on your specific application needs and hardware setup.
