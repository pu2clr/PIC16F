# PIC10F200 and DHT11 example


Developing the 'single-wire' protocol used by the DHT11 device on the PIC10F200 presents a challenge in several aspects:

* The memory limitation for data (only 16 bytes) complicates the development of a more robust implementation.
* The limited stack capacity, which is only capable of two levels, hampers the creation of more rational and readable code.
* Using the internal oscillator may not provide sufficient precision for time counting, which is a relatively critical feature for implementing this protocol.
* The absence of an 'Open-Drain' GPIO pin may require special attention in circuit design for more critical applications.
