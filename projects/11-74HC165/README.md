# PIC and 74HC165 device

The 74HC165 is an integrated circuit commonly used in digital electronics, known as a Parallel-in, Serial-out Shift Register. This device is particularly useful for expanding the input capabilities of a microcontroller, allowing it to read multiple input signals while using a minimal number of I/O pins. Here's a detailed description of the 74HC165:

1. **Functionality**:
   - The 74HC165 acquires data in parallel format from multiple input lines and then shifts this data out serially. This means it can take multiple input signals and send them to a microcontroller sequentially through a single pin.

2. **Pin Configuration**:
   - The device typically includes 16 pins, encompassing 8 input pins, pins for serial data output, parallel data load (PL), clock (CP), clock inhibit, shift/serial output, and power supply pins (Vcc and GND).

3. **Data Transfer Process**:
   - Data from input lines (parallel format) is loaded into the shift register when the Parallel Load (PL) pin is activated (usually a low signal). This loads the current state of all the input pins into the register.
   - The data in the shift register is then serially shifted out of the Serial Data Output pin with each pulse of the Clock (CP) input. This serial output can be read by a microcontroller or another digital device.

4. **Cascading Capability**:
   - Similar to the 74HC595, multiple 74HC165 chips can be cascaded. The serial output of one shift register can be connected to the serial input of another, allowing for the reading of an extended number of inputs with the same number of microcontroller pins.

5. **Applications**:
   - The 74HC165 is used in scenarios where a microcontroller needs to read multiple input signals but has a limited number of input pins. Common applications include reading the state of buttons, switches, or other digital sensors in a compact and efficient manner.

6. **Voltage and Current Specifications**:
   - It operates at standard logic levels and is typically powered by a 5V power supply, aligning it with the common operational voltages of most microcontrollers.

The 74HC165 shift register is valued for its ability to efficiently handle multiple inputs, its simplicity in interfacing with microcontrollers, and its flexibility in being cascaded for expanded input capabilities. This makes it an essential component in various digital systems where input pin conservation is crucial.
